# Algorithm Visualizer

Summary: This is a tool to help visualize the different famous algorithms learned in a common data structures and algorithms course. The aim of this project was to learn all the famous sorting algorithms, shortest path, graph, etc. 

# Sorting Algorithm
* [Merge Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-sort/#main) - when I view this algorithm, I think of two basic concepts: (divide and conquer) and (recursions). Once you've mastered these two concept merge sort should make a lot more since.  
* [Quick Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/)
* [Bubble Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/)


# Pathfinding Algorithm
* [Dikjstra's Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/)
